    <h3> A Doll's House 

        <br/>
        Author: Henrik Ibsen</h3>
        <p>_[THE SAME SCENE.—THE Christmas Tree is in the corner by the piano,
            stripped of its ornaments and with burnt-down candle-ends on its
            dishevelled branches. NORA’S cloak and hat are lying on the sofa. She
            is alone in the room, walking about uneasily. She stops by the sofa and
            takes up her cloak.]_
            
            NORA.
            [drops her cloak]. Someone is coming now! _[Goes to the door and
            listens.]_ No—it is no one. Of course, no one will come today,
            Christmas Day—nor tomorrow either. But, perhaps—_[opens the door and
            looks out]_. No, nothing in the letterbox; it is quite empty. _[Comes
            forward.]_ What rubbish! of course he can’t be in earnest about it.
            Such a thing couldn’t happen; it is impossible—I have three little
            children.
            
            _[Enter the NURSE from the room on the left, carrying a big cardboard
            box.]_
            
            NURSE.
            At last I have found the box with the fancy dress.
            
            NORA.
            Thanks; put it on the table.
            
            NURSE.
            [doing so]. But it is very much in want of mending.
            
            NORA.
            I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.
            
            NURSE.
            What an idea! It can easily be put in order—just a little patience.
            
            NORA.
            Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to come and help me with it.
            
            NURSE.
            What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold, ma’am,
            and make yourself ill.
            
            NORA.
            Well, worse than that might happen. How are the children?
            
            NURSE.
            The poor little souls are playing with their Christmas presents, but—
            
            NORA.
            Do they ask much for me?
            
            NURSE.
            You see, they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them.</p>
