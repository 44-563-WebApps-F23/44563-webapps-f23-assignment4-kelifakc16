    <p>
        <h5>NORA.</h5>
        <p><P>[drops her cloak].</P> Someone is coming now! _<p>[Goes to the door and
        listens.]</p>No—it is no one. Of course, no one will come today,
        Christmas Day—nor tomorrow either. But, perhaps—<p>_[opens the door and
        looks out]</p>_. No, nothing in the letterbox; it is quite empty. <p>_[Comes
        forward.]</p>_ What rubbish! of course he can’t be in earnest about it.
        Such a thing couldn’t happen; it is impossible—I have three little
        children.</p>

       <P> _[Enter the NURSE from the room on the left, carrying a big cardboard
        box.]_</P>

        <h5>NURSE.</h5>
       <p> At last I have found the box with the fancy dress.</p>

       <h5> NORA.</h5>
        <p>Thanks; put it on the table.</p>

        <h5>NURSE.</h5>
        <p><p>[doing so].</P> But it is very much in want of mending.</p>

        <h5>NORA.</h5>
        <p>I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.</p>

       <h5>NURSE.</h5> 
        <p>What an idea! It can easily be put in order—just a little patience.</p>

       <h5>NORA.</h5> 
       <p>Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to come and help me with it.</p>

       <h5>NURSE.</h5> 
       <p> What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold, ma’am,</p>
        and make yourself ill.

       <h5>NORA.</h5> 
       <p>Well, worse than that might happen. How are the children?</p>

       <h5>NURSE.</h5> 
       <p>The poor little souls are playing with their Christmas presents, but—</p>

       <h5>NORA.</h5> 
       <p>Do they ask much for me?

       <h5>NURSE.</h5> 
       <p> You see, they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them.</p>
